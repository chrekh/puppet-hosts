# hosts

A template-based module to manage /etc/hosts. The main goal for this
module is to add entries for localhost and primary address based on
existing ip-adresses on existing interfaces. Tested by me on Gentoo,
SLES, RedHat, and OS X. But it should work or any Linux and Unix-like
OS.

This module unconditionally overwrites your hosts file. You have been
warned! There are two reasons that this is template-based.

## Usage

```puppet
class { 'hosts': }
```

## Parameters

file
----
The file to add host entries to.
- *Default*: '/etc/hosts'

lo_ipv4
-------
List of IPv4 addresses for localhost. Empty list means no entry.
- *Default*: [ IPv4 loopback addresses ]

lo_ipv6
-------
List of IPv6 addresses for localhost. Empty list means no entry.
- *Default*: [ IPv6 loopback addresses ]

lo_names
--------
List of names for localhost.
- *Default*: [ 'localhost' ]

primary_ipv4
------------
List of IPv4 addresses. Empty list means no entry.
- *Default*: [ IPv4 addresses (not loopback or multicast) ]

primary_ipv6
------------
List of IPv6 addresses. Empty list means no entry.
- *Default*: [ IPv6 addresses (not loopback, multicast, or linklocal) ]

primary_names
-------------
List of names for primary addresses.
- *Default*: [ $::fqdn, $::hostname ]

one_primary_ipv4
-----------------
If true, only use the first address from primary_ipv4
- *Default*: true

one_primary_ipv6
-----------------
If true, only use the first address from primary_ipv6
- *Default*: true

enable_ipv4
-----------

If false, don't add IPv4 loopback or primary addresses. (IPv4
addresses from hosts::entries is still added)
- *Default*: true

enable_ipv6
-----------
If false, don't add IPv6 loopback or primary addresses. (IPv6
addresses from hosts::entries is still added)
- *Default*: true

include_ifs
-----------
A list of regexp. If the list is empty addresses from all interfaces are
included. If the list is not empty only addresses from interfaces matching any
of the regexps are included.
- *Default*: empty

exclude_ifs
-----------
A list of regexp. Exclude addresses from interfaces that match any of the
regexps.
- *Default*: empty

Note that the regexps in include/exclude_ifs can only iclude or exclude
addresses from fact networking[interfaces][*], the address in fact
networking[ip] and networking[ip6] is always included.

include_ipv4
------------
A list of regexp. If the list is empty all IPv4 addresses are included. If the
list is not empty all IPv4 addresses matching any of the regexps are included.
- *Default*: empty

include_ipv6
------------
A list of regexp. If the list is empty all IPv6 addresses are included. If the
list is not empty all IPv6 addresses matching any of the regexps are included.
- *Default*: empty

exclude_ipv4
------------
A list of regexp. Exclude IPv4 addresses that matches any of the regexps.
- *Default*: empty

exclude_ipv6
------------
A list of regexp. Exclude IPv6 addresses that matches any of the regexps.
- *Default*: empty

Note that the regexps in include/exclude_ipv4/ipv6 is used to fillter the
collected addresses for all interfaces, both loopback and other. Contents
explicitly entered by param 'entries' is not filtered at all.

entries
-------
A hash with additional host entries to add. Entries in this hash
overrides automatic hostentries for IP's on local interfaces.
The content can be either comment => { ip => [ names ], ... } or just ip => [ names ].
- *Default*: {}

## Example

```puppet
class { 'hosts':
    one_primary_ipv4 => false, 
    one_primary_ipv6 => false,
    entries => { '192.168.2.1' => [ 'foo.example.org', 'foo' ] }
}
```

## Hiera example

```yaml
hosts::one_primary_ipv4: false
hosts::one_primary_ipv6: false
hosts::entries:
  '::2':
    - 'localhost2'
  'Foocluster nodes':
    '2001:db8:abba::1':
      - 'node1.example.org'
      - 'node1'
    '2001:db8:abba::2':
      - 'node2.example.org'
      - 'node2'
```
